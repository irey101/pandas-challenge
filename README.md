# Pandas-Challenge Analysis
Math and reading scores are pretty steady and show a clear pattern across different grade levels when we look at each unique school.

From the visual data frames, it’s clear that Math passing scores are consistently low across the board. In contrast, Reading passing rates tend to be higher in schools with lower overall performance and those with higher student spending.

A notable trend is that the top 5 performing schools are all Charter Schools, while the bottom 5 are District Schools. It also looks like spending per student is higher in the lower-performing schools compared to the higher-ranked ones.

When it comes to passing rates, schools with smaller student populations tend to have higher passing rates compared to those with over 2,000 students. This might make sense because with fewer students, it’s easier to achieve a higher passing rate. For instance, if 1 out of every 4 students passes, that’s 25%, but with a larger group, a passing rate of 1 in every 8 students might still look similar.
